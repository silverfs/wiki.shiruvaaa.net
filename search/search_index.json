Underneath, we had the physical server. we installed the desired Operating System on it and run the application on top of the operating system. Each physical machine would run only one application. You can already guess where I\u2019m going to\u2026</p> <p> </p> <p>There are some problems with this model. First of all, we have to purchase a physical machine. Believe me, those can be very expensive. We might end up only using a fraction of the CPU or a memory of the machine. The rest of the resources would be simply wasted. Secondly, deployment time is often slow. The process of purchasing and configuring your physical server can take ages; especially for big organizations. Thirdly, it would be painful to migrate our applications to servers from different vendors. </p> <p> </p> <p>Underneath we have the physical server. There, we would install the desired Operating System. On top of the OS, a hypervisor layer is introduced which allows us to install multiple virtual machines (VM) on a physical machine. Each VM can have a different Operating system. In this way, we can run multiple Operating Systems, on a single physical machine and each Operating System can run a different application. This is the traditional model of virtualization which is being referenced as the hypervisor-based virtualization. Some of the popular hypervisor providers are VMware and VirtualBox. In the early stage, users would deploy VM\u2019s on their own physical servers, but nowadays, more and more companies have been shifted to deploy VM\u2019s in the cloud with providers such as AWS and Microsoft.</p> <p>There are some huge benefits with this model. First of all, it is more cost efficient. Each physical machine is divided into multiple VM\u2019s and each one only uses it\u2019s own CPU, memory and storage resources. We pay only for the compute power storage and other resources you use with no upfront commitments which is a typical pay-as-you-go model. Secondly, it\u2019s easy to scale with VM\u2019s deployed in the cloud environment. If we wanted more instances of our application, we don\u2019t need to go through the long process of ordering and configuring new physical servers. We can simply deploy a new VM with one click of a mouse. This reduces the time to configure and deploy from weeks to minutes!</p> <p>of-course, it still has limitations:</p> <p>First of all, each VM still needs to have an OS installed. This means that each VM has a full OS with it\u2019s own memory management, device drivers, daemons, etc. We would have to run a whole OS on one server, simply for one application. Secondly, application portability is not guaranteed. Some progress had been achieved in getting virtual machines to run across different types of hypervisors, there is still a lot of work to be done there. VM portability is still at an early stage.</p>"},{"location":"docker/the%20basics%20of%20docker%20and%20virtualization/#container-based-virtualization","title":"Container-based Virtualization","text":"<p>Finally, the Container virtualization technology was dropped. Docker is an implementation of container-based virtualization technologies. Let\u2019s take a look at this diagram here. </p> <p> </p> <p>Underneath, we have our server. This can either be a physical machine, or a virtual machine. Then, we install the operating system on the server. on top of the OS, we install a container engine, which allows us to run multiple guest instances. Each guest instance is called a container. Within each container we install the application and all the libraries that the application depends on.</p> <p>The key to understand the difference between the hypervisor-based virtualization model and the container-based model, is the replication of the models. In the traditional model, each application is running in it\u2019s own copy of the kernel and the virtualization happens at the hardware level. In the new model, we only have one model which has supplied different binaries and runtime to the applications running in isolated containers. So, the container has shared the base runtime kernel, which is the container engine. For the new model, the virtualization happens at the operating system level. Containers shared the host\u2019s OS and is thus much more efficient and light-weighted.</p>"},{"location":"docker/what%20is%20docker%20swarm/","title":"What is Docker Swarm?","text":""},{"location":"docker/what%20is%20docker%20swarm/#clusters","title":"Clusters","text":"<p>Docker Swarm is a tool that \u201cclusters\u201d many Docker Engines and schedules containers.

The key-size of AES can be 128/192/256 bits, but it encrypts data using 128 bit-sized blocks, which is equivalent to 16 bytes.

The reason why it takes longer to encrypt/de-crypt a 256-bit length key, is because a longer key length needs more complex mathematical operations, so it takes longer to compute a larger key in comparison to a shorter one. </p>"},{"location":"rabbit-holes/cryptography/#testing","title":"Testing","text":""},{"location":"rabbit-holes/cryptography/#key-generation","title":"Key Generation","text":"<p>I will elaborate the theory by providing an example written in Python with the Encryption module. We will operate with <code>hazmat</code>, the hazardous materials of the cryptography library. In its most basic form, cryptography uses Fernet, but to use different kinds of encryption methods, one needs to dive into the hazmat section, as implementations made with these functions are more prone to being implemented wrongly. With that out of the way, let\u2019s get started.</p> <pre><code>from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend\nfrom cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes\nfrom cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2 import PBKDF2HMAC\nimport os\n\n\nef generate_aes_key(password):\n    salt = os.urandom(16) # Generate random salt\n    print(\"Salt:\", salt\n    kdf = PBKDF2HMAC(\n        algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),\n        length=32, # 256 bits (here 32 bytes) for AES-256\n        salt=salt,\n        iterations=100000, \n        backend=default_backend()\n    )\n    key = kdf.derive(password.encode())\n    return key\n\n\n# Example\npassword = \"secure_password\"\naes_key = generate_aes_key(password)\nprint(\"AES Key:\", aes_key)\n</code></pre> <p>Firstly we create a randomly generated salt using 16 bytes as the length. The salt is used as an additional input to increase the security of key derivation to ensure that the derived key is unique, even if the same password is used multiple times. </p> <p>Next, we use PBKDF2HMAC (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 Hash Message Authentication Code), which is a password-based Key derivation function in combination with the integrity and authenticity assurance of HMAC. PBKDF2HMAC is then used in combination with the SHA-256 hash algorithm to derive a secure AES key from a password. AES-256 requires a 256-bit key, so a 32-byte key is suitable (16 bytes is equivalent to a 128-bit sized key). The key derivation function is responsible for producing a key of the desired size.  Finally, <code>iterations=100000</code> means that the underlying hash function (SHA-256 in this case) will be applied 100000 times to derive the final key. Multiple iterations slow down key derivation, adding computational expense for attackers attempting brute-force or dictionary attacks, and thus more protected against brute-force or dictionary attacks.</p> <p>In the example part, PBKDF2 is used with SHA-256 as the hash function to derive a secure AES key from a password.</p> <pre><code>&gt; pipenv run python aes.py\n\nSalt: b'\\x02\\xbc\\xb7x\\x1c**4O\\xf4\\xad\\xf3\\x1c|\\xb1\\xfa'\n\npbkdf2hmac key:  b'\\x1aTEoNa\\x030M\\xa3\\xf1s,$\\x9a\\\\M\\xa8\\xbf\\xa08J\\x9a\\xe3\\xc5\\x00\\x19CC\\xe4\\x0f/'\n\npassword:  secure_password\n\nAES Key: b'\\x1aTEoNa\\x030M\\xa3\\xf1s,$\\x9a\\\\M\\xa8\\xbf\\xa08J\\x9a\\xe3\\xc5\\x00\\x19CC\\xe4\\x0f/'\n</code></pre> <p>But in this part, we only created a key from the password.

The message is divided into blocks, and each block is encrypted separately.\u201d</p> <p>!!!  caution     Although it is generally not recommended to use this mode of encryption due to its lack of variability and it not being suitable for encrypting data in general any longer, I will use it as a simplified approach to showcase how cipher blocks work.      The ECB method lacks diffusion (hiding the plaintext statistics by spreading it over a larger area of ciphertext). Because ECB encrypts identical plaintext blocks of data into identical ciphertext blocks as mentioned earlier, it does not hide patterns well, making it not recommended for use in cryptographic protocols.</p> <p>Writing it down is one thing, but to truly understand, you\u2019ll have to experience it for yourself. </p> <p>So, we\u2019ll take a detour for a moment and convert our Python encryption block above to something that shows ECB blocks step by step:</p> <pre><code>from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher, algorithms, modes\nfrom cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend\nfrom cryptography.hazmat.primitives import padding\n\ndef aes_encrypt_ecb_debug(key, plaintext):\n    cipher = Cipher(algorithms.AES(key), modes.ECB(), backend=default_backend())\n    encryptor = cipher.encryptor()\n\n    # Padding the plaintext\n    padder = padding.PKCS7(algorithms.AES.block_size).padder()\n    padded_plaintext = padder.update(plaintext) + padder.finalize()\n\n    ciphertext_blocks = []\n\n    # Encrypt each block independently\n    for i in range(0, len(padded_plaintext), algorithms.AES.block_size):\n        block = padded_plaintext[i:i + algorithms.AES.block_size]\n        encrypted_block = encryptor.update(block)\n        ciphertext_blocks.append(encrypted_block)\n\n        # Print intermediate results\n        print(f\"Block {i // algorithms.AES.block_size + 1} plaintext: {block.hex()}\")\n        print(f\"Block {i // algorithms.AES.block_size + 1} ciphertext: {encrypted_block.hex()}\")\n        print()\n\n    return b''.join(ciphertext_blocks)\n\n# Example usage\nkey = b'Sixteen byte key'  # 128-bit key for AES-128\nplaintext = b'Hello. This is plaintext for my ECB AES walkthrough! Lets make our string longer so we can have more blocks. Those sentences were not enough, so let us add one more.'\n\nencrypted_data = aes_encrypt_ecb_debug(key, plaintext)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(\"Final Encrypted Data:\", encrypted_data.hex())\n</code></pre> <p>in the example above, we start with the same start of the function by providing the Cipher algorithm and the encryption mode for AES.</p> <p>The use of padding</p> <p>Next, we add some padding. Padding, specifically in the context of of encryption, is a process of adding extra bits to a piece of data to make it fit a specific block size. But why should we need it?  </p> <p>AES in ECB mode operates on fixed-size blocks of data. Let\u2019s say we take in 128-bit size blocks for AES, but the provided plaintext cannot divide itself evenly over 128-bit sized blocks, it needs extra padding to make up for the length.</p> <p>So, If the length of the plaintext is a multiple of the block size, it means that the length can be divided evenly into complete blocks without any remainder. If it\u2019s not a multiple, there will be a remainder when dividing by the block size and padding might be needed. </p> <p>Let\u2019s say the block size is 16 bytes (128 bits). A plaintext length of either, 16, 32, 48, and so on, would be a multiple of the block size. If the plaintext is not a multiple, additional padding ensures that the last block is filled to make it a multiple. In our example above, we use the padding standard scheme PKCS#7. </p> <p>Info</p> <p>The word \u201cplaintext\u201d consists of 9 characters. Typically - assuming ASCII or UTF-8 encoding - each character typically requires 1 byte.  In this case, the word \u201cplaintext\u201d would be 9 bytes long.  In the context of AES with a block siz of 128 bits (16 bytes) is a length of 9 bytes not a multiple of 16. We need additional padding to make up for it.  PKCS#7 adds bytes equal to the number of bytes needed for padding. For \u201cplaintext\u201d, it would look like this:  <code>\"plaintext\\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07\"</code> <code>\\x07</code> represents the number of padding bytes (7 bytes) to make the total length a multiple of 16 bytes.  </p> <p>Padding is not always needed. In cases where padding introduces issues or it needs to be implemented and used in a more simpler way, methods like Ciphertext Stealing (CTS) can be used. CTS is \u201ca method of using a block cipher mode of operation that allows for processing of messages that are not evenly divisible into blocks without resulting in any expansion of the ciphertext, at the cost of slightly increased complexity\u201d, which means that it can encrypt a plaintext block without padding the message to a multiple of the block size. So, instead of adding extra padding to fill up the block, this method \u201csteals\u201d some ciphertext from the previous block to complete the last one. </p> <p>Now that we know that padding is needed, we add it to the script as in our example above.</p> <p>After that, a for-loop is introduced which iterates over blocks of the padded plaintext using the block size of AES with ECB, which in this case is 16 bytes. </p> <p><code>block = padded_plaintext[i:i + algorithms.AES.block_size]</code> extracts a block of data from the padded plaintext. It starts with <code>i</code> and includes the next AES block size bytes.  Next, the current block is encrypted using AES. This, of course, happens block per block. After encryption of the current block, it appends the encrypted block to a list called <code>ciphertext_blocks</code>. </p> <p>After that, it tries to print the hexadecimal representation of the current plaintext block, and the ciphertext (encrypted) block below it. It repeats this process until no further blocks are found. </p> <p>After the loop ends, <code>return b''.join(ciphertext_blocks)</code> is used to concatenate (or simply join them together) into the final encrypted data, which is printed as well. </p> <p>At the end, we add the sixteen byte key and a plaintext worthy of having 2 blocks. The output looks somewhat like this:</p> <pre><code>&gt; pipenv run python aes_ecb.py\n&gt; \nBlock 1 plaintext: 48656c6c6f2e205468697320697320706c61696e7465787420666f72206d7920454342204145532077616c6b7468726f75676821204c657473206d616b65206f757220737472696e67206c6f6e67657220736f2077652063616e2068617665206d6f726520626c6f636b732e2054686f73652073656e74656e63657320776572\nBlock 1 ciphertext: 734326e08f5d4c2927597d492740efb622fe74e49044ce0228cc5353196578067269781e02250a10afbb3807897f1867daba7b3273f30b620bc5df4a5537975cc66c8d47304b3043b553500d6fbc7fe4e9f1d24e4ca73660d3c8a18a4e34c0616b7a3edbfebb0bee6bbe8a7f219c0c7793c625471d92238bec618f659b482e53\n\nBlock 2 plaintext: 65206e6f7420656e6f7567682c20736f206c657420757320616464206f6e65206d6f72652e0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b\nBlock 2 ciphertext: 79b906b7c49bf211867ee1322ed4c5f19dc302a8ce376db53f10f2335d63cd5f3ab99134759ed851844a9e6a4244d14b\n\nFinal Encrypted Data: 734326e08f5d4c2927597d492740efb622fe74e49044ce0228cc5353196578067269781e02250a10afbb3807897f1867daba7b3273f30b620bc5df4a5537975cc66c8d47304b3043b553500d6fbc7fe4e9f1d24e4ca73660d3c8a18a4e34c0616b7a3edbfebb0bee6bbe8a7f219c0c7793c625471d92238bec618f659b482e5379b906b7c49bf211867ee1322ed4c5f19dc302a8ce376db53f10f2335d63cd5f3ab99134759ed851844a9e6a4244d14b\n</code></pre> <p>Interestingly, Block 2 has a lot of <code>0b</code>s in its plaintext. <code>0b</code> is hexadecimal, and represents the number 11. this means that 11 bytes of padding were added.

As discussed prior in the AES segment, ECB is one such mode, but not secure in the slightest. Taken from the same Wikipedia page: \u201cThe purpose of cipher modes is to mask patterns which exist in encrypted data.\u201d If ECB is not capable of masking in a secure way, than what modes are? </p> <p>CBC (cipher block chaining) is one of the most widely used mode of operation. However, it still has its drawbacks. 2 of them are as follows: the use of sequential encryption and that messages must be padded to a multiple of the block size, just like ECB.  Like ECB, CBC makes use of sequential encryption, which refers to encrypting data in a linear manner; typically, one block of data at a time. As seen in the examples above, data is typically divided into fixed-sized blocks, and the encryption of one block is dependent on the encryption of the previous block. However, even if ECB and CBC both use sequential encryption, they are fundamentally different. In ECB mode, each block is encrypted with the exact same key, whereas with CBC, each block is XORed with the ciphertext of the previous block before encryption. This is called a chaining mechanism and should provide better diffusion than not using chaining at all. </p> <p>Obviously, the opposite variant is parallel encryption, which encrypts multiple blocks of data simultaneously. The most obvious bonus point is its speed of encryption. However, it might be more suitable for multi-thread architectures as it needs to exploit parallel processing power. </p> <p>Parallel encryption is not necessarily more secure than sequential encryption, if implemented correctly. Both have its advantages and concerns. Parallel encryption for example, may have faster processing times, but might introduce new vulnerabilities because it is less tested than sequential encryption in e.g. CBC mode.</p> <p>There exist many different modes and variants, with each their own advantages, use-cases, and drawbacks. </p>"},{"location":"rabbit-holes/cryptography/#rsa","title":"RSA","text":"<p>RSA stands for \u201cRivest-Shamir-Adleman\u201d, which are the 3 last names of the founders of this method of encryption. RSA is a cryptographic system that involves a public and a private key. The public key is used for encryption, and the private key is used for decryption. </p> <p>How it works</p> <p>RSA makes use of a private key and a public key. When presenting 2 parties - call them Alice and Bob - each of them has their own private and public keys. The private key is obviously private to its own party, but the public key can be shared to anyone. Unless implemented badly, messages encrypted using the public key can only be decrypted with the private key.</p> <p>RSA encryption is not typically used to directly encrypt large messages. Encrypting something using a public/private key pair is usually done to confirm the authenticity of the content. You cannot encrypt a lot of information with the RSA encryption technique, but you can encrypt a large message content separately using AES.</p> <p>So, encrypting something using a public/private key pair like RSA, is commonly employed for ensuring the authenticity and confidentiality of the content. However, due to the computational cost associated with asymmetric encryption algorithms like RSA, they are not as efficient for encrypting large amounts of data directly.</p>"},{"location":"rabbit-holes/cryptography/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":""},{"location":"rabbit-holes/cryptography/#afterword","title":"Afterword","text":"<p>Honestly speaking, this topic is incredibly difficult to understand, and I am sure I missed a lot of key parts on how certain mechanics work.
