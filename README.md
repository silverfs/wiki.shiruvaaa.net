This is an MkDocs template that gives you a clean-looking and automated way to publish your Obsidian notes on your Github pages. Sick.

It is a website based on Material theme, complete with a search bar. Checkout this template repo [here](https://jobindjohn.github.io/obsidian-publish-mkdocs/). The Obsidian/Roam style `[[wikilinks]]` from your vault can be used without a problem. There's even a toggle between light and dark mode!


If you want to use this template, I highly suggest you to go to the original repository.
MkDocs documentation can be found [here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/).
