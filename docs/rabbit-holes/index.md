_[From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_the_rabbit_hole)_
> "**Down the rabbit hole**" is an English-language [idiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiom "Idiom") or [trope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trope_(literature) "Trope (literature)") which refers to getting deep into something, or ending up somewhere strange. [Lewis Carroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll "Lewis Carroll") introduced the phrase as the title for chapter one of his 1865 novel _[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland")_, after which the term slowly entered the English vernacular. The term is usually used as a metaphor for distraction. In the 21st century, **the term has come to describe a person who gets lost in research or loses track of time while using the internet.**"

That's us right here ❤️. 

I welcome you down the rabbit hole. This is the place where I'll research stuff to my heart's content. As you dive into certain topics, you'll come to find that some of them have way more information than others. Don't worry, that's totally normal. It could mean that I didn't have the time to research all there is to it, or it could mean that I simply forgot about it and moved on. 
So, if you think a certain topic needs a little *poke*, you know where to find me. 
Please bear with me as we cover the known and unknown from places we've been a thousand times, to point-of-views never seen before.

If you like this stuff, you could also check out my "blogpost" website https://stories.shiruvaaa.net. If a rabbit-hole is cool enough, it'll appear on this website. 

Now, with all that out of the way, I wish you happy reading.


Cheers ✨
