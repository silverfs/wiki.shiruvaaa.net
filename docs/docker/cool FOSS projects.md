# Cool (FOSS) Projects

!!! info
	I'm not affiliated with any of the mentioned projects and services. I have simply taken a liking to them and would like to show others how nice they are to use with your own Docker instance.

## My Recommendations


### Portainer 

[Portainer](https://github.com/portainer/portainer) is a lightweight service delivery platform for containerized applications that can be used to manage Docker, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and ACI environments. Meaning: a GUI for your containers, Images, Volumes and more (Super cool!).
