# Windows 11 Installation Without Bloatware

This page does not need to be long, so let's dive right into it.

1. When choosing a language in the installation process, begin by selecting "English (World)" as your region during the setup process. 
2. In the 'Time and Currency Format' dropdown, choose " European English" or "English (World)"".  
This choice might trigger an error message labeled "OOBEREGION" due to language codes. (which is good!)
3. Don't worry if you see the red error message. Just click 'Skip' to continue the installation.  


The benefit? A clean Windows 11 installation without unnecessary apps â€“ only the essential ones remain.
